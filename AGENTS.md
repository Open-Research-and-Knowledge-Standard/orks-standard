# orks-standard

Part of **ORKS (Open Research & Knowledge System)**. Roles: `standards`.
Access this session: **read-write**.

The project profile is authoritative. It is held in a repository that is not
public and is deliberately not named here; an agent working in this project
resolves it through the runtime, not through this file. This file is generated and carries no rules of its own. It does **not** restate the full authority chain: this repository is public and the chain names repositories that are not. **A document not listed in the chain does not govern**, and the chain is read from the profile, not from here.

## Rules for this repository

Declared at `RULES.md`. Read it before changing anything here.

## Authority chain

| # | Repository | Path | Owns |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 12 | `orks-standard` | `RULES.md` | `orks-standard`'s own rules |
| 13 | `orks-conformance` | `RULES.md` | `orks-conformance`'s own rules |
| 14 | `.github` | `RULES.md` | `.github`'s own rules |

**11 entries are withheld** - they name repositories that are not
public, and this file is. The count is stated rather than the names: a reader
outside cannot act on them, and a short chain and a filtered one must not look
alike. An agent inside the project reads the full chain from the profile.
